This sketchbook is a collection of projects that I hope will be of use to other developers.  These projects aren't necessarily the gold standard for solving the problem at hand, and I would welcome any constructive feedback or pull requests!

Unless otherwise specifically noted, any of these examples will run on your choice of Java EE 7-compliant application server, but the written instructions will make a few assumptions:

- Maven 3.x is installed and its bin directory is on the PATH.
- Java 1.8+ is installed and its bin directory is on the PATH.
- JBoss EAP 6+ or WildFly 8+ is the target application server, and JBOSS_HOME is set.
